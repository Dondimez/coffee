In my project, I created an interactive coffee sales dashboard using Excel. The dashboard includes line charts that display total sales over time, split by coffee type, as well as bar charts that show sales by country and a top five customers chart. I also included interactive features like slicers for roast type, size and loyalty cards, along with a timeline to make the data easier to filter and explore.

Throughout the project, I used XLOOKUP and INDEX and MATCH functions to automatically populate customer names, emails and product information based on specific IDs. This allowed me to quickly reference and display important details in the dashboard.

I also imported product data from a separate dataset and took the time to rename and format columns to make everything clearer. I used formulas, like IF, to display full coffee names and adjusted the formatting for dates, sizes and prices to improve readability.

To analyze the data, I created tables and inserted Pivot Tables to organize the sales data by coffee types and countries. I then generated charts to visualize the data, customizing them with different colors, fonts and styles to make the dashboard visually appealing.

One of the key features I added was the use of slicers and a timeline, which allowed me to filter data by roast type, size and loyalty cards. I also customized their appearance to make them stand out and more user-friendly. For users with smaller screens, I added scroll bars to ensure they could easily view all elements of the dashboard.

Finally, I connected all the charts to the slicers and timeline, making the dashboard fully interactive. I adjusted the layout, added titles and removed unnecessary gridlines to give it a polished and professional look.

This project helped me gain valuable experience in Excel, particularly with functions like XLOOKUP ,INDEX and MATCH, as well as creating interactive and visually appealing dashboard.
